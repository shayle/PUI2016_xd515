## Assignment 3: Practice formulating the null hypothesis 

Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:


- Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise? 

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

### null hypothesis H0: The people who are in tested group weigh more or equal to the people who are in control group.
    
### alternative hypothesis Ha: The people who are in tested group weigh less than the people who are in control group.

### P0 - P1 >= 0

- Do American trust the president?

POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23).
Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

### null hypothesis H0: The people who said 'yes' were less or equal to these who said 'no'.

### alternative hypothesis Ha: The people who said 'yes' were more than these who said 'no'.

### P0 - P1 <= 0

- Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking. 

Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

### null hypothesis H0: The average cessation rate for smokers who used nicotine patches is smaller or equal to that of people who used placebo patches.

### alternative hypothesis Ha: The cessation rate for smokers who used nicotine patches is bigger that of people who used placebo patches.

### P0 - P1 <= 0

- Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. 

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

### null hypothesis H0: The average IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age of women who smoked is higher or equal to that of children of women who did not smoke.

### alternative hypothesis Ha: The average IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age of pregant women who smoked is lower than that of children of pregant women who did not smoke.

### P0 - P1 >= 0
