Hi Ian,

This is Xiaomeng, and I am lucky to be paired with you. Your project is very clear and easy to read. Nice job! I learned a lot 

from your coding style. I hope I can learn more from you in the future.

About the IDEA

I think there is a possible prmise that you should check the data of citibikes supplyments for different docks and find the differences. What if people in no-boundry areas want to borrow bikes but find there are not enough? Thus the data of starttime would not exsit whereas the demand exsits.

About the Hypothesis

I am totally agree with your h0 and h1. I would make this argument in your project.

About the test

I think you could take t test for what you are comparing are means.

Comments

It is wonderful to do this project along with GIS.
